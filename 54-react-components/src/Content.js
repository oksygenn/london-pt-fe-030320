        “We seldom realize, for example that our most private thoughts and
        emotions are not actually our own. For we think in terms of languages
        and images which we did not invent, but which were given to us by our
        society.” ― Alan Watts

        “This is the real secret of life -- to be completely engaged with what
        you are doing in the here and now. And instead of calling it work,
        realize it is play.” ― Alan Watts

        “The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is so plain and so obvious
        and so simple. And yet, everybody rushes around in a great panic as if
        it were necessary to achieve something beyond themselves.” ― Alan Wilson

        “To have faith is to trust yourself to the water. When you swim you
        don't grab hold of the water, because if you do you will sink and drown.
        Instead you relax, and float.” ― Alan Wilson Watts
